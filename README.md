    cd email-sender-agent
    ```

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your required API keys:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    ```

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

## Usage

- **Edit Email**: After generating the email, you can edit the content.
- **Send Email**: Once satisfied with the email, click "Send Email" to send the email directly from your Gmail account.

### Email Validation

The app validates the recipient's email format using a regular expression to ensure it's a valid email address before proceeding with sending the email.

### Email Format

The generated email includes:
1. A professional and formal greeting.
2. A clear, concise body based on the provided description.
3. A polite closing and signature.

The email will be sanitized for security using the `bleach` library to remove any unwanted HTML tags or attributes.
